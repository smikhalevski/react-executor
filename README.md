# react-executor

Asynchronous task execution and state management for React.

# Overview

Executor manages an async callback execution process and provides ways to access execution results, abort or replace an
execution, and subscribe to its state changes.

Create an `Executor` instance and submit a callback for execution:

```ts
const executor = new Executor();

executor.execute(doSomething);
// â®• AbortablePromise<void>
```

The `execute` method returns a promise that is fulfilled when the promise returned from the callback is settled. If
there's a pending execution, it is aborted and the new execution is started.

To abort the pending execution, you can use
an [abort signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
passed to the executed callback:

```ts
executor.execute(async signal => {
  // Check signal.aborted
});

executor.abort();
```

When execution is aborted the current `value` and `reason` remain intact.

To reset the executor to the initial state use:

```ts
executor.clear();
```

You can directly fulfill or reject an executor:

```ts
executor.resolve(value);

executor.reject(reason);
```

Subscribe to an executor to receive notifications when its state changes:

```ts
const unsubscribe = executor.subscribe(() => {
  // Handle the update
});

unsubscribe();
```

```ts
useExecutor(`order-${orderId}`, initialValue, [
  // Persists the executor value in the synchronous storage.
  syncStorage(localStorage),

  // Instantly aborts pending task when executor is deactivated (has no active consumers). 
  abortDeactivated(),

  // Disposes a deactivated executor after the timeout.
  disposeDeactivated(5_000),

  // Invalidates the settled executor result after the timeout.
  invalidateAfter(10_000),

  // Invalidates the settled executor result if another executor with a matching is fulfilled or invalidated.
  invalidateByPeers([/verification/, /account/]),

  // Retries the latest task of the active executor if it was invalidated. 
  retryStale(),

  // Retries the latest task of the active executor if the window gains focus. 
  retryFocused(),

  // Binds all executor methods to the instance.
  bindAll(),
]);
```

# Retry a failed task

For example if you want to fetch a user, and instantly retry if the fetch fails:

```ts
import { retry } from 'parallel-universe';
import { useExecutor } from 'react-executor';

const userExecutor = useExecutor(
  'user',
  () => retry(async signal => {
    const response = fetch('/user', { signal });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(response.statusText);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
);
```

Read more about [`retry`](https://github.com/smikhalevski/parallel-universe?tab=readme-ov-file#retry) helper.

You can combine `retry` and [`timeout`](https://github.com/smikhalevski/parallel-universe?tab=readme-ov-file#retry)
helpers:

```ts
import { retry, timeout } from 'parallel-universe';
import { useExecutor } from 'react-executor';

const userExecutor = useExecutor(
  'user',
  () => timeout(
    retry(async signal => {
      // Handle user fetching here
    }),
    10_000
  )
);
```

# Retry a task on window focus

Since executors have stable identity, you can use `useEffect` to trigger refetches when an arbitrary event occurs:

```ts
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useExecutor } from 'react-executor';

const userExecutor = useExecutor('user', async signal => {
  // Handle user fetching here
});

useEffect(() => {
  const handleFocus = () => {
    userExecutor.retry();
  };
  
  window.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleFocus, false);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('visibilitychange', handleFocus);
  };
}, [userExecutor]);
```

# Dependent tasks

Let's assume we need to fetch a user, and after it is successfully fetched, we need to fetch the user's shopping cart:

```ts
import { useExecutor } from 'react-executor';

const userExecutor = useExecutor(
  `user-${userId}`,

  async signal => {
    // Fetch a user
  }
);

const cartExecutor = useExecutor(
  `cart-${userId}`,

  async signal => {
    // ðŸŸ¡ Pause the task until the user executor is fulfilled
    const user = await userExecutor.get().withSignal(signal);

    // Fetch the user's shopping cart
  }
);
```

# Optimistic updates

To implement optimistic updates, resolve the executor with the expected value and then execute a server request.

For example, if you want to instantly show that user that they set a reaction, use this code pattern:

```ts
const reactionExecutor = useExecutor('reaction', false);

const handleClick = () => {
  reactionExecutor.resolve(true).execute(() => {
    // Handle the request and return an actual status
  });
};
```

# Invalidate executor results

To invalidate an executor that isn't directly used in the component:

```ts
const executorManager = useExecutorManager();

useEffect(() => {
  executorManager.get('user')?.invalidate();
}, []);
```
